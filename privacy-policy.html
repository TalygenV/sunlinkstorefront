Many web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of our Sites may not work if you delete or disable cookies.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-500 text-[20px]">We use the following types of cookies:</p>
                   <ul class="list-disc text-gray-500 pl-10 text-[20px] space-y-2">
                     <li>Strictly Necessary: These cookies are essential to operate the Sites and provide you with services you have requested. They cannot be switched off.</li>
                     <li>Functional: These cookies enable certain features or non-essential functionality on our Sites. For example, we might use these cookies to recognize you and remember your preferences or settings when you return to our Sites so we can provide you with a more personalized experience.</li>
                     <li>Targeting Cookies: These cookies allow us and third parties to learn more about you, including your use of our Sites and other websites, and to advertise products/services that might interest you as further indicated below.</li>

                 <p class="text-gray-500 text-[20px]">We and third parties also use tools that enable us to track certain aspects of a user’s visit to our Sites. This technology helps us better manage content on our Sites by informing us what content is effective, how consumers engage with our Sites, and how consumers arrive at and/or depart from our Sites. The software typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) “tracking pixels” and (2) “clear gifs.” Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether a user views a web page or email message. User activity information may be associated with additional information about a user’s session and Personal Information, if provided by the user. You can opt-out of certain types of cookies and other tracking tools by managing your preferences through our Sites (e.g., by clicking the cookie icon at the bottom of the homepage). If you arrive at our Sites by “clicking through” from another website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you searched that led you to our Sites, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the privacy policy of any website from which you reached our Sites to determine what information the operator collects and how it uses such information. We may retain information about you provided to us by other websites and will use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Such information may be associated with other Usage Data or Personal Information.</p>

                  <p class="text-gray-500 text-[20px]">We may work with third-party advertisers, search providers, and ad networks (“Advertisers”) to learn more about you and show you ads or other content that we believe would be relevant to you. Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of our Sites or Services as well as other websites and services. These companies may use cookies and other online tracking technologies to collect and use your information. We and/or Advertisers may also append other data to the data collected by Advertisers to create an interest profile of individual users. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use by an Advertiser of information that they may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via our Sites or on third-party websites. If you want to limit interest-based advertising, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page. The DAA website allows you to opt-out of one or more interest-based advertising networks. Opt-outs are device and browser specific; therefore, you will need to set your opt-out preferences for each device and browser. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt-out preferences; however, the DAA offers browser extensions that help preserve the opt-out preferences you set on the DAA's Consumer Choice Page. Please note that opt-outs only apply to interest-based advertising. You may still receive other types of online advertising. Your device or browser may also provide features to further limit interest-based advertising or online tracking by Advertisers.</p>
